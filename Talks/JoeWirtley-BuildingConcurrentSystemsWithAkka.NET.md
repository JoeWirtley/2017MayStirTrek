Building concurrent systems is challenging.  Code that is innocuous when run on a single thread can require a tangle of locking when running on multiple threads.  One way to address this problem is leveraging the actor model.  Akka.NET implements the actor model and is ideal for developing concurrent, scalable, and fault tolerant applications in .NET.  In this session, you will see code to create actors, send messages to actors, and handle messages within actors. You will also learn about advanced capabilities of Akka.NET including routing, location transparency, persistence, and clustering. You will leave with ideas of how you might use Akka.NET in your own projects and resources to continue your exploration.
